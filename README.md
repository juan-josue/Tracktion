# Tracktion

Tracktion is an innovative full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) web application that switches up project management by incorporating gamification elements. With dynamic leaderboards, animated avatars, XP-based levelling systems, and quests. Tracktion creates an engaging and competitive environment fostering user engagement and driving enhanced productivity. Combining elements of gamification with traditional project management, Tracktion offers a unique and enjoyable approach to planning and executing projects.
